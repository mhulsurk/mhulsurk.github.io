	There are several optional flags:  <br/>  <br/>
	
	laxpc_make_spectra   [-u (user gti asci file)]   <br/> 
         [-r resp_files] [-l Layer no] [-g Energy grouping factor] level2.event.FITS	  <br/>  <br/>

	[-u (user gti file)]: Optional user gti file in FITS format  <br/>
	    This can be produced either by "laxpc_make_stdgti" command 
	    or by the user using "laxpc_make_lightcurve".   <br/>
	    See README file and README_LC for details.  <br/>
	    Default: none  <br/>  <br/>
	 
	 
	 [-l Layer no] Which of the five Layers to be considered.  <br/>
	    Default is all. At this version only first layer or all 
	    can be considered.  <br/>  <br/>

	 [-g Energy grouping factor] Energy grouping factor.  <br/>
	    See details below. Default is 0.05  <br/>  <br/>


	  [-r resp_files] ) OPTIONAL: The correct responses will be picked up   
	  by the code in Default mode.   <br/>
	  However, the user MAY provide a file containing the names of the response file.   <br/>
	  The first no. is the number of the LAXPC(1,2,3) followed in the same row the name of the response file.   <br/>  <br/>

	 Output:  <br/>  <br/>

	
	 The following files will be produced   <br/>  <br/>
	  
	  (1) spectrum_10.pha, spectrum_20.pha and spectrum_30.pha  <br/>  <br/>
	  
	  (3) spectrum_grp_10.pha, spectrum_grp_20.pha and spectrum_grp_30.pha  <br/>  <br/>

	  If Layer 1 has been, the files will have an additional _L1 in their
	  names.  <br/>  <br/>

	  The last files are GROUPED in energy using grppha command.  <br/>
	  See Note below:  <br/>  <br/>


	  NOTE: The spectrum files contains all the Header information
	of the event  file used. Additionally the responses if
	provided are included. If usergti file has been given then the
	usergti extention is added to the fits lightcurve file.   <br/>  <br/>
	
	Note on Grouping. LAXPC channels can be as many as 1024.
	The energy range to be considered from say 3-80 keV will
	have a large number of channels. However, the energy
	resultion of LAXPC is approximately 15%. So it is
	optimal to have three energy bins per resultion or
	at 5% level. The code reads the channel to energy
	conversion in the response file to group the
	spectrum at 0.05 level which is the default. The
	value can be changed by the flag -g . For example
	-g 0.1 will group at 10% level. Grouping can be
	shutoff (no group files produced) by -g 0.0
	Using the grouped file for spectral fitting
	is highly recommended.
