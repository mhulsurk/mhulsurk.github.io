	There are several flags:  <br/>  <br/>

	 -h  Maximum Frequency for the power spectrum in Hz]  <br/>
	     Default value is 100 Hz.  <br/>  <br/>
	     
	 -l  Minimum Frequency for the power spectrum in Hz]  <br/>
	     Default value is 1 Hz. NOTE: For a power spectrum 
	     minimum frequency is also the frequency resultion.  <br/>
	     Since for FFT segemnts must be size of 2 the power  
	     multiples, the actual minimum frequency used may
	     slightly differ from what is given.  <br/>  <br/>

	 -f  Frequency at which  lags are to be computed in Hz ]  <br/>
	   Default: If not specified the lag will be computed at
	   the frequency where the power is maximum.  <br/>  <br/>
	
 	 -p (which pcu? all or e.g. 12)]: Which PCU units to be considered.  <br/> 
		1--> LAXPC 10 only, 12 ---> LAXPC 10 and 20, all --> All units.
		Default value is all	  <br/>  <br/>
	
	 -u (user gti file)]: Optional user gti file   <br/>
	    This can be either in:   <br/>
	    (i) ascii giving start and stop times,  <br/>
	    e.g.  A file 'usergti' containing:  <br/>
	    500.3 3000.1  <br/>
	    3500.0 4550.34  <br/>
	    or  <br/>
	    (ii) a Fits GTI file with START and STOP columns  <br/>  <br/>
	 
	    The time can either be in absolute time or time relative to
	    Tstart. Both will be interpreted correctly.  <br/>  <br/>

	    Default: usergti  <br/>  <br/>
	 
	  -o output filename]: Root of output file name  <br/>
	    Default: level2.event  <br/>  <br/>
	 
	  -e energy define file]: File containing energy ranges.  <br/>
	     An example file is given. Default file name is
	     'eneinput'. If file does not exist, default energy range
	     chosen is two energy band 3-15 and 15-30 keV.   <br/>Upto
	     nine energy bands can be given. The first energy
	     band given will be taken as the reference energy band.  <br/>
	     The energy bands should not overlap i.e. 3-15 and 10-30
	     keV bands are not allowed.   <br/>However, 3-15 and 15-20 are
	     allowed i.e. the energy band need not be contigious.  <br/>  <br/>
	     
	  -r The PCU of the refernce energy band]  <br/>
	    If r is given as 1, then the reference energy band
	    will be taken from PCU 10 and the other energy bands
	    from 20 and 30.   <br/>DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU ARE SURE WHAT
	    THIS MEANS.  <br/>  <br/>

      It is often desired to rebin the power spectra in 
      frequency and to create equivalent pha files which 
      allows the power spectra to be fitted using Xspec.  <br/>  <br/>
      
      Requires:  <br/>
      1) list of *Pow files generated by Fits_FreqLag_V1_Nov30  <br/>
      This is an ascii file listing the files generated.  <br/>  <br/>

	Usage:  <br/>
	IMPORTANT: Always initialize heasoft (by for e.g. "heainit") 
	           before running the code.  <br/>  <br/>

	There are three flags:  <br/>  <br/>

	 -s  The signal to noise (SNR) ratio that the power spectra 
	     will be binned to   <br/>
	     Default:5  <br/>  <br/>
	     
	 -l   the minimum frequency width which any bin will have 
	   irrespective of its SNR.   <br/>
	   The value is given as f+df/f. In other words if the
	   value is given as 1.1, then the minimum frequency bin width
	    log10 binning will be log10(1.1).  <br/>
	   Default:1.05  <br/>  <br/>

		
	 -h   the maximum frequency width which any bin will have
	   irrespective of its SNR.   <br/>
	   The value is given as f+df/f. In other words if the
	   value is given as 2.0, then the maximum frequency bin width
	   log10 binning will be log10(2.0).  <br/>
	   Default:2.0  <br/>  <br/>

	   Output:  <br/>  <br/>

	   If Pow files are of the form:  <br/>
	   N"Pow_outputfile  <br/>
	   then output files will be of the form:  <br/>  <br/>

	   reb_Pow_level2.event.pha"N"  <br/>
	   where N = 1,2,3...  <br/>  <br/>

	   These are Xspec readable spectral files with response
	   and Deadtime corrected Poisson level as the background.
