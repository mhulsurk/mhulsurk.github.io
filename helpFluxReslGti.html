	laxpc_fluxresl_gti  <br/><br/>

	Given a Fits lightcurve, produces a GTI file corresponding to 
	the times when the rate in the lightcurve was between 
	a minumium value (ratemin) and  maximum value (ratemax).  <br/>
	The GTI file produced can then be used to generate spectra 
	and other science products.   <br/>  <br/>
	

USAGE:  <br/>
laxpc_fluxresl_gti -l ratemin -h ratemax -o output_gti_filename filename.lc  <br/>  <br/>

Note: laxpc_make_spectra will always produce spectra with the same names, 
such as spectrum_grp_lx10.pha etc. So to do flux resolved spectroscopy 
it is best to create seperate directories for each flux level and 
compute spectra and background spectra seperately in that directory using the 
GTI file produced by this program.
