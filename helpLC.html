	[-t timebin] [-u (user gti asci file)] [-o output filename]   <br/>
         [-e energy define file] [-l Layer no] level2.event.FITS  <br/>  <br/>

	
 	[-p (which pcu? all or e.g. 12)]: Which PCU units to be considered.   <br/>
		1--> LAXPC 10 only, 12 ---> LAXPC 10 and 20, all --> All units.  <br/>
		Default value is all  <br/>  <br/>

	[-t timebin]: Time bin for lightcurve in seconds.   <br/>
        	Default value is 1.0 seconds  <br/>  <br/>
	
	[-u (user gti file)]: Optional user gti file   <br/>
	    This can be either in:   <br/>
	    (i) ascii giving start and stop times,  <br/>
	    e.g.  A file 'usergti' containing:  <br/>
	    500.3 3000.1  <br/>
	    3500.0 4550.34  <br/>
	    or  <br/>
	    (ii) a Fits GTI file with START and STOP columns  <br/>
	 
	    The time can either be in absolute time or time relative to  <br/>
	    Tstart. Both will be interpreted correctly.  <br/>  <br/>

	    NOTE: a 'usergti.fits' file will be produced which means  <br/>
	    that the earlier usergti.fits file will be overwritten!!  <br/>
	    copy any earlier version is you want to save the earlier usergti.  <br/>  <br/>
	    
	    A ascii text file called lcusergti.txt is also produced  <br/>
	    giving the GTI used. This can be more easily edited to  <br/>
	    give more constrained user GTIs.  <br/>  <br/>

	    Default: none  <br/>
	 
	 [-o output filename]: Root of output file name  <br/>
	    Default: lightcurve  <br/>  <br/>
	 
	 [-e energy define file]: File containing energy ranges.  <br/>
	     An example file is given. Default file name is  
	     'eneinput'.   <br/> If file does not exist, default energy range 
	     chosen is a single lighcurve of 3-80 keV.  <br/>  <br/>

	 [-l Layer no] Which of the five Layers to be considered.  <br/>
	  Default is all. At this version only a single  layer or all  
	  can be considered.  <br/>  <br/>
	  
	     

	 Output:  <br/>  <br/>

	 If the output root file is the default value of 'lightcurve'  <br/>
	 the following files will be produced:  <br/>  <br/>

	 (1) lightcurve.txt: Ascii text File containing counts/sec with time 
	 for the energy bands asked for. Useful for plotting and quick look.  <br/>  <br/>

	 (2) A series of Fits files of the form:  <br/>
	 lightcurve_Emin_EmaxkeV.lc  <br/>  
	 where Emin and Emax are the energy range asked for.   <br/>  <br/>
     
     (3) If usergti ascii file has been given a corresponding   
	 fits usergti file with absolute corresponding time.  <br/>  <br/>

	

	NOTE: The lightcurve files contains all the Header information
	of the event  file used. Additionally the energy range is
	put in as Emin, Emax and TIMEDEL and PCUS which notes which
	PCUs were used. if usergti file has been given then the
	usergti extention is added to the fits lightcurve file.
