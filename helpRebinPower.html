
      It is often desired to rebin the power spectra in 
      frequency and to create equivalent pha files which 
      allows the power spectra to be fitted using Xspec.  <br/>  <br/>
      
      Requires:  <br/>
      1)A file containing the  list of *Pow files 
      generated by laxpc_find_freqlag.   <br/>This file called
      powfiles is produced by laxpc_find_freqlag.  <br/>  <br/>
      
      
	There are three flags:  <br/>  <br/>

	 -s  The signal to noise (SNR) ratio that the power spectra
	     will be binned to   <br/>
	     Default:5  <br/>  <br/>
	     
	 -l   the minimum frequency width which any bin will have
	   irrespective of its SNR.   <br/>
	   The value is given as f+df/f. In other words if the
	   value is given as 1.1, then the minimum frequency bin width
	    log10 binning will be log10(1.1).  <br/>
	   Default:1.05  <br/>  <br/>

		
	 -h   the maximum frequency width which any bin will have
	   irrespective of its SNR.   <br/>
	   The value is given as f+df/f. In other words if the
	   value is given as 2.0, then the maximum frequency bin width
	   log10 binning will be log10(2.0).  <br/>
	   Default:2.0  <br/>  <br/>

	   Output:  <br/>  <br/>

	   If Pow files are of the form:  <br/>
	   N"Pow_outputfile  <br/>
	   then output files will be of the form:  <br/>  <br/>

	   reb_Pow_level2.event.pha"N"  <br/>
	   where N = 1,2,3...  <br/>  <br/>

	   These are Xspec readable spectral files with response
	   and Deadtime corrected Poisson level as the background.
